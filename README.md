# Semester-Project-3


## To DO:
* Show name of user thatâ€™s logged in (at the top of the menu next to logout button)
* Show one movie from database (get the id through the button)
* Save data into database from API sort it by title and description
* Path to image (can't get the right path)
* Need help with adding comments to database
* Search function (so we can search on a movie)
* Ask how much we need to use the database (the project we could find on the internet, they don't use the database for the functionality)
